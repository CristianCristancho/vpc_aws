## Object Storage Vs. Traditional Block and File Storage

- <u>Block Storage:</u> Low  level number (raw), and manage data as fixed-size blocks
- <u>File Storage:</u> High level OS level: structure and hierarchy of files / folders
- Both accessed from a Storage Area Network (SAN):
  - Protocols: Fibre Channel, iSCSI, Network attached storage (NAS) file server
    - Over NFS (Network File System) or CIFS (Common Internet File System)
- All depends of the OS / Server.

 <u>Amazon S3:</u>
<i>Objet Storage</i> Server independent and accessed over the Internet
  - Use and API based on standard HTTP.
  - Each object contains data and metadata.
  - Objects reside on <b><i>buckets</i></b> and identified by unique user-specific key.
  - Buckets are flat folder with no File System: unlimited # of objects. No sub-buckets.
  - Operations: GET and PUT
  - No worry to replication, capacity planning, scalability: S3 automatically partitions buckets to support high request, replicate across regions and simultaneous access users.
