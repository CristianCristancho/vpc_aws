## WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING?


“ Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.   ”

## BASIC CONCEPTS

###  Regions

 * An AWS region is a physical geographical location that consists of a cluster of data centers
 * Each region  is completely independent and isolated from the other ones.


###  Availability Zone

 * An Availability Zone is one or more data centers within a region that are designed to be isolated from failures.
 * Availability Zones provide inexpensive, low-latency network connectivity to other zones in the same regions.

## CLOUD COMPUTING DEPLOYMENT MODELS

###  All-in cloud-based application

 * It is  when an applications is fully deployed in the cloud.
 * The application could have been created from scratch or migrated from an existing infrastructure.
 * Cloud-based applications can use  low-level infrastructure or high-level services provided by AWS.  

###  Hybrid deployment Model

 * It is an architectural pattern providing connectivity for infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not in the cloud.
